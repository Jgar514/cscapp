# Cape St. Claire, Maryland 3D Web Application

To structure this project we divided the neighborhood of Cape St. Claire into four quadrants.

I then listed key locations that fall into each quadrant which will eventually become it's own React component. I also have a 'Global Quadrant" that appear in all of the quadrants.

| Quadrant 1 | Quadrant 2 | Quadrant 3 | Quadrant 4 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Main Beach   | Lake Claire   | Broadneck Highschool   | Cape Shopping Center   |
| Cape Club House    | Boat Ramp  | Broadneck Library  | Cape Field  |
| Bay   | Deep Creek  | Broadneck Athletics    | Fire House  |
